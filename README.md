## Updating Vector Images

All (or at least most) vector based images were made with 
[Provector](https://provector.app) which is an online and free Vector 
editing webapp.


The Saved File is a `.json` file which is stored in the 
`docs/provector/vectors/` directory.  The export of the images are saved in 
the `docs/provector/images` directory.
