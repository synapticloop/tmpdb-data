# Technical Details



## Directory structure

- `/data/` - for mechanical pencil data
- `/documentation/` - for documentation output, or written
- `/meta/` - directory for meta information about the generation of pencils
- `/scripts/` - scripts for running the various generators


- `/output/` - For generated files, the subdirectories are named for the output 
  file format type and will have subdirectories beneath it that are more 
  descriptive of 
  what the output contains: **NOTE:** '`This directory is designed to be 
  transient`' and can be deleted without side effects, this can be 
  re-generated by the renderer at any time.  For example, some of the file 
  formats generated are: 
  - `/output/png/` - Generated PNG files 
  - `/output/svg/` - Generated vector (SVG) files 
  - `/output/pdf/` - Generated document (PDF) files

## Updating CustomVector Images

All (or at least most) vector based images were made with 
[Provector](https://provector.app) which is an online and free Vector 
editing webapp.


The Saved File is a `.json` file which is stored in the 
`docs/provector/vectors/` directory.  The export of the images are saved in 
the `docs/provector/images` directory.
