### Accuracy Designations

#### low

 - Where any one of these things are true.
 - Physical pencil not present for measurement
 - Measurements of the pencil were not taken with a precision tool, and may have been estimated from supplied images.
 - The overall look of the pencil and the relative dimensions should be within reasonable and relative bounds.
 - The pencil may be based on a third party branded model that is identical to the original.
 - It is unlikely that internal measurements have any level of relative accuracy, and, where supplied have been estimated.
 - There may be a low level of accuracy of the colours of the pencil's parts.

#### medium

 - Where any one of these things are true.
 - Physical pencil present, however no precision measurement tool was used.
 - Physical pencil not present and image used for measurements, an accurate measuring scale is included with the image.
 - Not all pencil measurements were taken with a precision tool, (especially where there are internal components which access could not be gained).
 - External measurements may have been accurately measured, however internal components may not have been measured.
 - The pencil may be based on a first/third party branded model that is identical to the original.
 - The accuracy of the colours of the pencil's parts may not be reflected by the rendered images.

#### high

 - Where all of these things are true (with caveats).
 - Physical pencil used for measurements, or physical pencil not present, but source technical documents used for measurements.
 - Pencil measurements taken with a high precision tool.
 - Internal measurements may not be available due to disassembly challenges.
 - The accuracy of the colours of the pencil's parts may not be reflected by the rendered images.

#### unknown

 - The accuracy level for this mechanical pencil could not be determined.
 - The accuracy of the colours of the pencil's parts may not be reflected by the rendered images.
